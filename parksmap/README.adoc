= Parksmap application

This Spring Boot application is a frontend web gateway to backend services that provide geolocation data on services

== Building the application

The application can be built using Maven:

[source,bash]
----
mvn -s ../nexus_settings.xml clean package spring-boot:repackage -DskipTests -Dcom.redhat.xpaas.repo.redhatga
----

This will create a jar file target/parksmap.jar that can be used in a binary build for OpenShift. The S2I Builder image to use is `redhat-openjdk18-openshift:1.2`.


== Deploying the Application

The application needs permission to dynamically discover the available routes (with label `type=parksmap-backend`) in the project.

[source,bash]
----
oc policy add-role-to-user view --serviceaccount=default
----

There is an endpoint `/ws/healthz` that returns `OK` when the application is running.



=== List backend

You can list the backends that the application discovered:

[source,bash]
----
curl -i http://<parksmap_route>/ws/backends/list
----
