= Nationalparks backend application

This application is a SpringBoot backend that provides geolocation information about National Parks worldwide. The information is stored in a MongoDB.

== Building the application

The application can be built using Maven:

[source,bash]
----
mvn -s ../nexus_settings.xml clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
----

This will create a jar file target/nationalparks.jar that can be used in a binary build for OpenShift. The S2I Builder image to use is `redhat-openjdk18-openshift:1.2`.

== Deploying the Application

The application needs a MongoDB database to store its data. This can be a shared MongoDB database for the entire project since the application stores the data in its own collection `nationalparks`.

Nationalparks expects the MongoDB connection information in the following environment variables:

* DB_HOST=mongodb (Name of the MongoDB Service)
* DB_PORT=27017 (Port the MongoDB Service is running under)
* DB_USERNAME=mongodb (Username for the MongoDB database)
* DB_PASSWORD=mongodb (Password for the user)
* DB_NAME=parks (Database Name)
* DB_REPLICASET=rs0 (Name of the Replicaset if MongoDB is deployed as a Stateful Service. Not set for standalone database)

The exposed route to the application needs a label `type=parksmap-backend` for the frontend to dynamically discover the service.

There is an endpoint `/ws/healthz` that returns `OK` when the application is running.

The endpoint `/ws/info` returns some basic information about the service.
